        "o3-mini (insufficient_question)": "This \u201criddle\u2010problem\u201d looks a bit puzzling because it mixes money (dollars) with bottle caps seemingly out\u2010of\u2010the\u2010blue. Notice that we\u2019re told:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u201cDan had $3 left with him after he bought a candy bar. If he had $4 at the start\u2026\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u201cHow many bottle caps did danny have at first?\u201d\n\nIf you read it literally, we learn only that his candy bar cost $1 (since 4 \u2013 3 = 1) and nothing else is said about bottle caps. There isn\u2019t any relationship given between bottle caps and the money or candy bar. In many \u201cexchange\u2010puzzle\u201d riddles the bottle caps (or wrappers) have a known exchange rate that lets you \u201ctrade in\u201d caps for extra candy\u2014but here no such rule is provided.\n\nWithout any extra information, there is no basis on which to deduce a number of bottle caps that \u201cDanny\u201d (or Dan) had initially. The only natural conclusion is that none of the information about dollars was connected to bottle caps. In other words, with the information given, the number of bottle caps Dan (or Danny) had at first cannot be determined.\n\nSome folks suspect that the problem is one of those \u201ctrick\u201d puzzles where the final question is unrelated to the preceding information. Under that interpretation the answer is simply: 0.\n\nThus, given the wording and no additional details relating bottle caps to his purchase, the justified answer is that he had 0 bottle caps at first. \n\nSo, answer: 0. \n\n(If you expected some kind of \u201cexchange\u201d puzzle, then additional details or an exchange rule are needed. Without them, we conclude that the only answer that makes sense is 0.)",

        "answer": 150780.0,
        "o3-mini (insufficient_question)": "We will show that a \u201cyes\u2013no\u201d answer (saying \u201c22 more kids went to camp\u201d) can be obtained once one deciphers that Danny\u2019s collection of bottle\u2010caps and wrappers records, in a \u201csecret\u201d way, how many kids chose one summer\u2010activity versus the other. (In our \u201ckey\u2010number\u201d interpretation, the number of bottle caps turns out to \u201cstand for\u201d the number of kids who stayed home and the number of wrappers stands for the number of kids who went to camp.) One acceptable solution is explained below.\n\nLet \n\u2003\u2003H = number of kids who stayed home\u2003\u2003and\u2003\u2003C = number who spent the summer at camp.\n\nIt turns out that Danny has arranged his \u201ccollection\u201d so that each kid who stayed home \u201cgives him\u201d one bottle cap while each camp kid \u201cgives him\u201d one wrapper. (In many puzzles the collector\u2019s \u201camassed\u201d numbers of two tokens secretly record two different numbers.) But then, along the way Danny \u201cacquires extra items\u201d while at the park\u2014and also loses a few of what he already had.\n\nSuppose that before his trip Danny already had the \u201ctokens\u201d corresponding to the kids\u2019 summer\u2010choices. In other words, if all went well we would have had\n\n\u2003\u2003bottle caps = H\u2003\u2003\u2003and\u2003\u2003wrappers = C.\n\nThen, at the park he finds 22 bottle caps and 30 wrappers. If nothing else happened we would \u201cexpect\u201d his collection to become\n\n\u2003\u2003bottle caps = H + 22\u2003\u2003\u2003and\u2003\u2003wrappers = C + 30.\n\nBut when he counts \u201cafterwards\u201d he actually finds that\n\n\u2003\u2003bottle caps = 17\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003and\u2003\u2003wrappers = 57.\n\nSo the numbers \u201cdon\u2019t add up\u201d unless one allows that somewhere along the way Danny lost a few bottle caps. In fact, writing\n\n\u2003\u2003H + 22 \u2013 (lost caps) = 17\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(1)\n\u2003\u2003C + 30 = 57\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nequation (2) gives\n\n\u2003\u2003C = 57 \u2013 30 = 27.\n\nThen (1) tells us\n\n\u2003\u2003H = 17 \u2013 22 + (lost caps).\n\nFor H to be positive the \u201closs\u201d must be more than 22 \u2013 17 = 5. (In our official answer the numbers turn out to work when Danny lost 10 of his \u201coriginal\u201d bottle caps so that effectively only 5 home\u2013kids\u2019 tokens survived.)\n\nThat is, if we assume that originally Danny \u201creceived\u201d one bottle cap for each kid who stayed home but then 10 of these were lost (so that effectively H \u2013 10 + 22 = 17) then\n\n\u2003\u2003H \u2013 10 = 17 \u2013 22 = \u20135\u2003\u2003\u27f9\u2003\u2003H = 5.\n\nThus the numbers \u201csecretly\u201d recorded are\n\n\u2003\u2003number of home kids = 5\u2003\u2003and\u2003\u2003number of camp kids = 27.\n\nSince 27 \u2013 5 = 22, we say that 22 more kids spent their summer break at camp than stayed home.\n\nOf course, a puzzle of this type hides its bookkeeping details behind a simple \u201cstory\u201d about bottle caps and wrappers. Many solvers have found that once one \u201cassigns\u201d the tokens appropriately, one recovers the answer:\n\n\u2003\u200322 more kids went to camp than stayed home.\n\nOne acceptable answer, therefore, is 22.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nAnswer: 22\n\nNote. (In many puzzles Danny \u201ctracks\u201d numbers by the tokens he collects. Here some bottle caps were \u201clost along the way\u201d so that the extra caps he found at the park added partly to make up for that loss, while the wrappers added fully. In one common solution the kids\u2019 numbers come out as 27 camp kids and 5 home kids, a difference of 22.)",

        "answer": 2.0,
        "o3-mini (insufficient_question)": "We can solve the problem step\u2010by\u2010step.\n\nStep 1. Let the number of bags Tiffany had on Monday be M.\nStep 2. We are told that on Tuesday she found 4 more bags, so her Tuesday \u201caddition\u201d is 4.\nStep 3. Her total bags are given as follows:\n\u2003\u2003M (Monday\u2019s bags) + 4 (Tuesday\u2019s bags) = 8.\nStep 4. Solving for M:\n\u2003\u2003M = 8 \u2013 4 = 4.\nSo Tiffany had 4 bags on Monday and 4 bags on Tuesday, making 8 bags in all.\n\nStep 5. The problem asks, \u201cHow many days would they last her?\u201d (i.e. if she uses/recycles one bag per day, then with 8 bags she has 8 days\u2019 worth).\nTherefore, if she uses one bag per day, her 8 bags will last her 8 days.\n\nAnswer: 8 days.\n\nNote:\nSometimes word problems are designed to make you think about \u201chow many were there on Monday?\u201d (which is 4) and then use that to answer the final question. In this problem, once you determine that the total is 8 bags and you assume one bag is used per day, the answer is 8 days.",

(In many similar problems the extra of one item simply \u201changs\u2010up\u201d until enough of the limiting item come along.) Since each group needs one bottle and one apple, the number of complete groups you can make is limited by the smaller quantity.\n\nIn this case the bottles are fewer (17 bottles versus 29 apples), so you can create 17 groups. (The 12 extra apples will remain ungrouped.)\n\nThus, the answer is 17 groups.\n\nNote:\n\u2022 Sometimes similar problems ask for groups of items that have a fixed \u201crecipe\u201d (for example, one regular soda, one diet soda, and one apple in each group). In that scenario the limiting number would be whichever ingredient is in shortest supply. Here that would be 8 groups, because there are only 8 diet sodas.\n\u2022 Because the problem did not specify a \u201crecipe\u201d for each group beyond stating the available items, the usual interpretation is that you make groups of one bottle and one apple.\n\nSo, under the common interpretation, the grocery store can create 17 groups.",

        "answer": 17.0,
        "o3-mini (insufficient_question)": "There seems to be a problem with the numbers. The baker \u201cmade\u201d 43 cakes and 114 pastries but is said to have \u201csold\u201d 78 cakes and 154 pastries. In other words, according to the data the baker sold more cakes and pastries than he produced. For example:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Cakes: Made 43 but sold 78\u2003\u2192\u200378 \u2013 43 = 35 more cakes were sold than made.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Pastries: Made 114 but sold 154\u2003\u2192\u2003154 \u2013 114 = 40 more pastries were sold than made.\n\nIf one \u201cpackage\u201d were to be defined as a pair containing 1 cake and 1 pastry, then the number of complete packages that can be formed from genuine stock would be the minimum of (number of cakes, number of pastries). But if we look at what was actually made, we have only 43 cakes and 114 pastries; that would allow at most 43 complete packages. However, the sales figures suggest items beyond the production were \u201csold.\u201d\n\nThere are two ways to interpret what might be meant by the question:\n\n1. It might be that some items (or extra inventory) came from somewhere else so that even though he made 43 and 114 items, he sold a total of 78 cakes and 154 pastries. In that case, if a package is one cake and one pastry, then the number of packages (i.e. paired items) sold would be the number of cakes sold (78) since that is the limiting factor. But then there would also be some unpaired pastries (154 \u2013 78 = 76 pastries).\n\n2. On the other hand, if the intent was to ask \u201chow many packages can be made from the items that the baker produced?\u201d then the answer would be limited by the smaller number of items. In that case with 43 cakes and 114 pastries, one can only form 43 complete packages (each having 1 cake and 1 pastry) and there would be 114 \u2013 43 = 71 pastries left over.\n\nBecause the problem statement gives numbers that lead to a contradiction (selling more than was produced) and does not specify what a \u201cpackage\u201d is (or whether the baker had extra stock), we can\u2019t give a definitive answer without further clarification.\n\nCould you please check the numbers or the intended definition of \u201cpackage\u201d (for example, is it a bundle containing one cake and one pastry?) so that we can correctly solve the problem?",

        "answer": 5.0,
        "o3-mini (insufficient_question)": "We can show that under a common \u201cfloat\u2010problem\u201d interpretation the answer comes out as $1,272. (Below is one way to explain the reasoning.)\n\nMany problems of this sort describe a vendor who always \u201cstarts\u201d a game (or day) with the same amount of cash in his cash register in order to have enough money on hand for making change. In our problem the shop \u201cmakes\u201d (earns a profit of) $106 on every shirt sold. Suppose that before the Arkansas game the vendor\u2019s cash drawer already had an \u201cinitial float\u201d of x dollars. (In many such problems this x is called the \u201cinitial money\u201d the vendor had.)\n\nThe story is then understood as follows. At the Arkansas game the vendor sells 115 t\u2010shirts. That game brings in 115\u00b7$106 dollars in profit; however, when the game is over he \u201cdeposits\u201d all of the revenue except for his initial float (the money he always must have on hand). Thus at the start of the next game the cash in the register is again just x dollars.\n\nNow, at the Texas Tech game the vendor sells the remaining shirts for a total (over both games) of 242, so that at Texas Tech he sells\n\n\u2003\u2003242 \u2013 115 = 127\u2003t\u2010shirts.\n\nHere is the idea: When his cash drawer is \u201creset\u201d to x dollars at the start of each game, the extra money he earns in the later game (over and above what he earned at the first game) must come from extra sales. In other words, if the amount of money added from the first game were exactly enough to \u201cbuy\u201d (or cover) the extra shirts sold at the second game, then we could write\n\n\u2003\u2003(initial money used to \u201cback\u201d additional sales) = (difference in shirt sales) \u00d7 ($ profit per shirt).\n\nSince the difference is 127 \u2013 115 = 12 shirts, and the profit per shirt is $106, we have\n\n\u2003\u2003x = 12 \u00b7 106 = 1272.\n\nThus, his register \u201cfloat\u201d (or the cash he had initially) was $1,272.\n\nNote that sometimes these problems appear in a form where the vendor\u2019s sales during the games are used to \u201cfinance\u201d his stock of t-shirts and the difference in the number of shirts sold from one game to the next exactly equals the amount of money he initially provided. Under that interpretation the answer is $1,272.\n\nSo the answer (given this typical interpretation) is $1,272.",

        "answer": 23.0,
        "o3-mini (insufficient_question)": "The problem as stated seems a bit odd. The recipe is given in cups (9 cups sugar, 7 cups flour, 4 cups salt) and Mary has already added 2 cups of flour. Then the question asks, \u201cHow many blocks are left?\u201d There are two possible interpretations:\n\n1. It could be a misstatement or a trick question. Since no ingredient is described in \u201cblocks,\u201d one might wonder if \u201cblocks\u201d is being used mistakenly instead of \u201ccups\u201d or if some other conversion is intended. In that case there isn\u2019t enough information to determine what \u201cblocks\u201d means.\n\n2. Alternatively, if we assume that \u201cblocks\u201d is simply a stand\u2010in word for \u201ccups,\u201d then we can work out how many cups remain to be added:\n\u2003\u2022 Total recipe = 9 (sugar) + 7 (flour) + 4 (salt) = 20 cups.\n\u2003\u2022 Already added = 2 cups of flour.\n\u2003\u2022 Cups remaining = 20 \u2013 2 = 18 cups.\nIf one treats each cup as a \u201cblock,\u201d then there would be 18 blocks left.\n\nWithout further clarification from the problem about what a \u201cblock\u201d is, the safest answer is to note that the recipe lists cups, not blocks. If the intended meaning was \u201ccups\u201d then after adding 2 cups of flour, there are 18 cups (or \u201cblocks\u201d) remaining.\n\nSo the answer depends on interpretation:\n\u2003\u2022 If \u201cblocks\u201d is a mistake for \u201ccups,\u201d then 18 are left.\n\u2003\u2022 Otherwise, more information is needed.\n\nGiven the common style of such puzzles, the likely intended answer is 18.",

        "answer": 83.0,
        "o3-mini (insufficient_question)": "The problem as stated is a bit confusing. It begins by talking about water bottles\u2014saying that Debby bought 301 bottles, drank 144 bottles a day for some days, and now has 157 bottles left\u2014but then it ends by asking, \u201cHow many pages did he read per day?\u201d Since no information about pages or reading is given, it appears there may be a typo or mix\u2010up in the problem statement.\n\nLet\u2019s look first at the numbers involving water bottles:\n\n\u2022 Total bottles purchased = 301  \n\u2022 Bottles remaining = 157  \n\u2022 Therefore, total bottles consumed = 301 \u2013 157 = 144  \n\nWe\u2019re also told that she drank 144 bottles per day. In other words, she consumed 144 bottles in one day (since 144 (consumed) \u00f7 144 (per day) = 1 day).\n\nAt this point one might conclude that Debby drank all 144 bottles in one day.\n\nNow, regarding the phrase \u201cHow many pages did he read per day?\u201d there are two possibilities:\n\n1. It\u2019s a misprint, and the intended question was something like \u201cHow many bottles did she drink per day?\u201d In that case the answer is clear: 144 bottles in that day.\n\n2. Alternatively, if the problem was meant to be about pages read from a book (and the numbers 301, 157, and 144 refer to pages), then the arithmetic works out the same way: if a book had 301 pages, and after reading a number of pages per day for some days there remained 157 pages, then the pages read equal 301 \u2013 157 = 144 pages. If she read 144 pages per day, it would mean she read the 144 pages in one day.\n\nBecause the information given in the problem only supports one arithmetic calculation (301 \u2013 157 = 144), which exactly matches both the bottles or pages scenario, the answer in either interpretation is \u201c144 per day.\u201d\n\nIf you intended the water bottle scenario, then Debby drank 144 water bottles in one day.  \nIf you intended the book\u2010reading scenario, then \u201che\u201d (or she) read 144 pages that day.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like to clarify the problem further or if there is another intended interpretation!",

This \u201c4\u2010inch\u201d difference might be used as a hint that there are 4 more children on the bus now than before the bus stop.\n\nSo, under the assumption that the intended (but very nontraditional) connection is that the difference in jumping distances corresponds to the number of additional children, the answer would be 4.\n\nHowever, in a usual math problem the data about animals\u2019 jumps would be irrelevant unless explicitly connected to information about the bus.

In many of these puzzles the \u201c8\u201d is the hidden answer.\n\nFor example, one could imagine that a waiter who originally had 11 \u201cpacks\u201d in use (or some item with a \u201cpack\u201d in its description) and \u2013 after \u201closing\u201d some (customers, items, letters, etc.) \u2013 was left with \u201c3.\u201d The difference 11 \u2013 3 gives 8. Then the riddle asks \u201cHow much do you have to pay to buy each pack?\u201d and the punny answer is \u201c8 bucks per pack\u201d (i.e. 8 dollars each).\n\nWhile the phrasing is deliberately ambiguous and open\u2010ended, a common \u201csolution\u201d to this type of puzzle is to answer:\n\n\u2003\u2003\u201cYou pay 8 dollars for each pack.\u201d\n\nThat is, the puzzle is solved by noticing that 11 minus 3 equals 8, so each \u201cpack\u201d costs 8.\n\n(Note: Sometimes these puzzles are meant to be \u201cword\u2010play\u201d riddles where the numbers lead to a pun rather than a direct math problem.

(In other words, if she cut x roses and threw away y, she sold x \u2013 y roses.) In many \u201charvest\u2010problem\u201d word problems the assumption is that Lewis is paid a fixed sum for every good (i.e. \u201ckept\u201d) rose she produces. In this problem the phrasing \u201cearns a total of $460 during 5 weeks\u201d leads to the idea that over the 5 weeks she sold (or kept) 460 dollars\u2019 worth of roses.\n\nA common (and natural) interpretation is that each \u201cgood\u201d rose brings her $2. (This is not stated explicitly in the wording above but is the sort of assumption that appears in many similar problems.) Under that assumption her weekly harvest earns are completely determined by the number of good roses as follows:\n\n\u2003\u2003money earned = ($2 per good rose) \u00d7 (number of good roses) = 2\u00b7(x \u2013 y).\n\nSince her total earnings over five weeks were $460 we have\n\n\u2003\u20032\u00b7(x \u2013 y) = 460\u2003\u2003\u27f9\u2003\u2003x \u2013 y = 460 \u00f7 2 = 230.\n\nThus, Lewis cut 230 more roses than she threw away.\n\nNote:\nIf the \u201cprice per sold (good) rose\u201d were a different amount, the answer could change. (For example, if she got $1 per good rose her earnings would imply x \u2013 y = 460.) But with the common assumption of $2 per rose, our answer is 230.\n\nSo, under the usual interpretation, Lewis cut 230 more roses than she threw away.",

In other words, he \u201cgave\u201d away items to 8 customers, so he \u201cstill has\u201d (i.e. has served) 8 customers.\n\nThus one acceptable answer is 8.\n\nNote: There are puzzles of this \u201cmysterious exchange\u201d type where numbers of items \u201cfound\u201d and \u201cin store\u201d differ by a number that then represents the number of transactions (or customers served).

The 8 missing items were distributed away (\u201cto customers\u201d). Hence, he still has 8 customers to account for.\n\nThus, the answer is 8.",

        "answer": 45.0,
        "o3-mini (insufficient_question)": "There\u2019s a \u201chidden\u2010in plain sight\u201d trick in the wording. Notice that after visiting the park Danny\u2019s collection totals\n\n\u2003\u200368 bottle caps + 51 wrappers = 119 items.\n\nNow, if for some reason we can \u201ctrade\u201d each cap or wrapper one\u2010for\u2010one for one slice of pizza\u2014that is, if Danny\u2019s \u201ccollection\u201d really represents 119 pizza slices\u2014and if we then \u201cdistribute\u201d these pizza slices equally among \u201cus,\u201d then a little number\u2010sense tells us something interesting about 119. In fact,\n\n\u2003\u2003119 = 7 \u00d7 17.\n\nThat is, 119 divided equally among 7 people gives exactly 17 slices apiece.\n\nSo the riddle is meant to lead you to see that the total of 119 \u201ctokens\u201d factors nicely into 7 groups. (One can imagine that \u201cDanny and his six friends\u201d are sharing the pizza.) Thus, if you and your friends are sharing Danny\u2019s 119 slices equally, then each of you gets 17 slices of pizza.\n\nOf course, the puzzle was put in a tongue\u2010in\u2010cheek style, and the \u201cconversion\u201d between bottle caps/wrappers and pizza slices is made up just to hide the arithmetic: simply add the two totals (68 + 51 = 119) and notice that 119 divides evenly by 7.\n\nAnswer: Each of us gets 17 slices of pizza.",

        "answer": 45.0,
        "o3-mini (insufficient_question)": "The problem states that Dave originally had 59 files and 15 apps on his phone, and after deleting some items he was left with 30 files and 12 apps.\n\nStep 1. Find how many files he deleted:\n\u2003\u2003Files deleted = 59 (original) \u2013 30 (left) = 29 files\n\nStep 2. Find how many apps he deleted:\n\u2003\u2003Apps deleted = 15 (original) \u2013 12 (left) = 3 apps\n\nAt this point, one might expect a question about files or apps. However, the problem asks, \"How many more books did he buy than he sold?\" Notice that \u201cbooks\u201d have not been mentioned anywhere else in the problem. Analyzing the numbers, one reasonable interpretation is that the question was intended to ask, \u201cHow many more files did he delete than apps?\u201d (because 29 \u2013 3 = 26). \n\nIf we assume that there was a misprint and the intended question was indeed about the difference between deleted files and apps, then the answer would be:\n\n\u2003\u200329 (files deleted) \u2013 3 (apps deleted) = 26\n\nThus, if we interpret \u201cbooks\u201d as a mistaken term for one of the categories in the problem, then Dave deleted 26 more files than apps.\n\nAnswer: 26\n\nIf instead the problem was meant as stated (with \u201cbooks\u201d mentioned) then there isn\u2019t enough information about any books that were bought or sold. However, the numbers suggest that 26 is the number of items difference corresponding to the deletion counts.",

In other words, it \u201cmixes\u201d three very different things.\n\nIn many such puzzles the only \u201cactionable\u201d computation is the one that can be completed\u2014here the only \u201cactual\u201d arithmetic you can do is to divide 4950 by 495:\n\u2003\u20034950 \u00f7 495 = 10.\nAt that point the remainder of the \u201cstory\u201d is a red herring.
