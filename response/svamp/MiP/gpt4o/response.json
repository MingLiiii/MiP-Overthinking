Let's denote the number of children that got off the bus as \\( x \\). Therefore, the equation is:\n\n\\[ 110 - x = 30 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ 110 - 30 = x \\]\n\\[ x = 80 \\]\n\nThis means 80 children got off the bus.\n\nNow, the second question about Danny finding wrappers and bottle caps appears unrelated and does not provide enough information to calculate an answer directly.

That seems unusually high for a human, so there might be a misinterpretation or hypothetical scenario here, but let's work with it as given.\n2. Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron, so Dean's height would be \\(13 + 4 = 17\\) feet.\n3.

To determine the number of packages Sofia will have, we need additional information about what constitutes a package and how the suggestions influence the formation of these packages.\n\nFor example, if each type of food suggestion results in a direct order of specific packages of food items (e.g., each suggestion leads to an order of a package that includes the suggested item), then we would need to know how many packages are ordered per suggestion. Alternatively, if the notion of \"packages\" ties into something like meal plans or collective groupings of these food items, more context is needed.\n\nHere are two hypothetical scenarios based on the limited information given:\n\n1. **Packages Per Suggestion:** If each suggestion corresponds directly to one package, then you would simply total the number of student suggestions for each food item. However, there's no indication of whether these suggestions overlap (e.g., some students may have suggested more than one item), so it's unclear how you should count them for \"packages.\"\n\n2. **Specific Package Definitions Needed:** If Sofia has predefined package types that combine these items in some way, then you need details on those specific configurations.

Books remaining after transactions (giving away and selling): 62\n\nFirst, calculate the number of books he got rid of (sold and given away):\n\nBooks originally - Books remaining = Books gotten rid of\n\n108 - 62 = 46 books\n\nOut of these 46 books, we know that 35 were given to his friend.

To understand Danny's collection status better, let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. At the park, Danny found:\n   - 29 bottle caps\n   - 82 wrappers\n\n2. Before adding the new items from the park to his collection, Danny already had a certain number of bottle caps and wrappers.\n\n3. After adding the items from the park, Danny now has:\n   - 42 bottle caps total\n   - 61 wrappers total\n\nTo determine how many bottle caps and wrappers Danny initially had before finding the new items, we can set up simple equations:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) represent the initial number of bottle caps.\n- Let \\( y \\) represent the initial number of wrappers.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n\n1. \\( x + 29 = 42 \\)\n2. \\( y + 82 = 61 \\)\n\nSolving these equations:\n\n1. \\( x + 29 = 42 \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   x = 42 - 29 = 13\n   \\]\n\n2. \\( y + 82 = 61 \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   y = 61 - 82 = -21\n   \\]\n\nSince \\( y \\) being negative does not make practical sense in this context (having a negative count of wrappers), it's crucial to re-evaluate the situation. It appears that there may be a misunderstanding or misreporting regarding the counts, as a negative number of wrappers isn't viable, indicating a possible error in the problem statement itself.\n\nThus, current data doesn't support providing the number of \"customers\" Danny has, nor is the negative count logical. Please confirm or clarify the aspects of the task if necessary.",

Let's address each part:\n\n1. **Cookies Calculation**:  \n   If you have 4 bags with an equal number of cookies and a total of 36 cookies, you can find out how many cookies are in each bag by dividing the total number of cookies by the number of bags:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cookies per bag} = \\frac{36 \\text{ cookies}}{4 \\text{ bags}} = 9 \\text{ cookies per bag}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Money at the End of the Harvest Season**:  \n   The original question doesn't provide any information about how the cookies relate to money or what events occur during the harvest season that would affect money.
