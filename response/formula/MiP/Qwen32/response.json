The notation \\(\\sinh((7) - \\kappa \\approx Y)\\) seems unclear. Typically, in mathematical expressions, the symbol \\(\\approx\\) (approximately equal to) is not used inside a function argument. For simplicity, let's assume that \\(\\kappa\\) and \\(Y\\) are constants and the expression simplifies to \\(\\sinh(7 - \\kappa)\\). \n\nNow, let's rewrite the expression with this assumption:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} \\sinh(7 - \\kappa) \\div 7 - 3 \\cdot 8 + I\n\\]\n\nSince \\(7 - \\kappa\\) is a constant, the hyperbolic sine function \\(\\sinh(7 - \\kappa)\\) is also a constant.
